# 🐇 Rabbit Planner

Rabbit Planner is a personal task and planning app built with **React**.  
The goal of this project is to create a simple, flexible planner that I can actually use day-to-day, while also strengthening my React fundamentals.

This project is being built iteratively — starting small and growing over time.

---

## ✨ Motivation

I wanted to build something that:
- I would personally use every day
- helps with planning tasks without strict time pressure
- allows creative freedom in UI and features
- improves my understanding of React, component structure, and state

Rabbit Planner is not about perfection — it’s about usability and learning.

## 📁 Project Structure

The app is structured using reusable, modular components:

- `Header` – App title and task controls  
- `TaskCard` – Individual task display  
- `Footer` – App footer (future use)  

Styles are scoped per component for clarity and maintainability.
